# Banking
Built an end-to-end Banking Risk Analytics dashboard using Power BI, Python, and MySQL. Performed EDA, created custom DAX measures (e.g., Engagement Days, Income Band), and visualized KPIs across loan and deposit metrics to help banks identify high-risk clients and make data-driven lendingÂ decisions.
